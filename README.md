# Magical Academy

Magical Academy is a roguelike-like set in a randomly generated world.
You are a new student at this school. Your goal is to graduate after 7 years of studying.

The goal of the game isn't to go full murder-hobo on the student body. There is no dungeons or epic quest of saving the world from a terrible evil. You aren't the hero nor the villain, just a student.
